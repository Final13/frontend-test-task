## Frontend Test Task

The task consists of two parts:

1. Create a component that shows floating and disappearing heart icons. Icons should appear at random positions and have random sizes. [Here](https://github.com/GIVESocialMovement/frontend-test-task/blob/main/public/files/floating_hearts.mov) you can find an example of the animation.

2. Update `/app/page.tsx` to display the `FloatingHearts` (created in the first step) when hovering over the `DonateButton`. The `DonateButton` is located inside `StepA`, which is in turn inside `DonateFlow`.

Please fork this repo to complete these test tasks.
You are free to add any packages you need and make any changes you want.
